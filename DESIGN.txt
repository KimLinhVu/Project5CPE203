Functions that stayed:
load and loadImages - both loads use a Scanner object as a parameter that reads lines from other files
processLine and processImageLine - process parses information from other classes
setAlpha - does not use objects from any classes in its methods or parameters
creates* - does not use objects from any classes, functions do not act on any objects
parses* - function does not act on objects from any other classes

Ambiguous Functions:
moveTo*
1. Entity class
2. I chose the Entity class instead of the WorldModel class because the method is moving an Entity to another Entity
object and it takes in two entity objects in its parameter.

nearestEntity/findNearest
1. WordModel class
2. I chose the WorldModel class because the parameter of the method is taking in a list of entities. It also makes
more sense that the WorldModel would have information on where the nearest Entity is than an Entity class.

getBackgroundImage
1. WorldModel class
2. I chose WorldModel over the Background class because the method's parameter took in a WorldModel object but not
a Background object.
